# 🎞️ Movie Recommendation Systems

A comprehensive implementation of various recommendation algorithms for movie suggestions, exploring different approaches from basic popularity-based methods to advanced hybrid systems.

## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates multiple recommendation techniques:

- **🔥 Popularity-Based**: Cold-start solution using top-rated movies (weighted rating - IMDB's formula)
- **📝 Content-Based**: Item similarity using metadata (movie description, genres, cast, directors, keywords)
- **👥 Collaborative Filtering**: User behavior-based recommendations
  - User-based filtering
  - Item-based filtering
  - Matrix factorization (SVD)
- **🔀 Hybrid Systems**: Combining multiple approaches for robust recommendations
